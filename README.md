# PD-for-Designers - Sound and Interaction
Pure Data issues for interaction design and sounddesign lectures at IdK/Fh Joanneum<br>
## Prototype with Arduino and Laptop:
Starts with actual Vanilla Version (currently 0.50)<br>
Download from Miller Puckettes http://msp.ucsd.edu/ download site http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html

Externals needed (install via deken, help->find externals, don't download directly): Zexy, comport, pduino

__Feeling unsecure in using PD:__
Work through the tutorials, especially recommended:

Johannes Kreidler:

__Getting Started:__https://blokas.io/patchbox-os/docs/GettingStarted/

__Etcher:__for copying disk images to sd-cards
https://www.balena.io/etcher/

You need a __VNC viewer__ to remotely control Your PiSound machine:

*Task for first workshop session:*
1. "Build" the Raspi-Sounds With Case etc.
2. Burn SD cards / Install Etcher
3. Test wireless connection and Pisound app
4. Start VNC and fiddle around with PiSound and the provided Software

*Homework*
1. Rename Your Wifi Hotspot SSID
2. Migrate Your ID/SD patch to the raspberry
2. Develop a testing situation without Arduino simulating the sensory input via Midi/OSC et al.

## Different additional topics
one by one patches we do at the lectures will be put here.
